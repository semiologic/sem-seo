"<strong>Note</strong>: What follows will occasionally contradict with what "

"Your page's &lt;title&gt; tag is very important. In addition to being "

"Meta keyword and description fields are mostly useless from an indexing "
"standpoint. Recall that Google's key innovation was to ignore them. If left "
"empty, the meta keywords field is automatically filled using the page's "
"categories and tags, and you are advised to leave it blank as a result. The "
"meta description deserves a special note, however."

"Recent research suggests that the meta description field is used by Google "

"Links often get discounted, but in the end, inbound links <em>always</em> "

"The Semiologic and Semiologic Reloaded themes have heading tags, in sidebars "

"New and/or updated content counts, and that is one of the reasons blogs fare "

"Your keywords can be noise words just as much as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;"

"Duplicate content issues on third party sites are very real. Fight content "

msgid ""
"In addition to being useless, adding nofollow attributes to internal links "
"is a sure way to ultimately get your site penalized on grounds that you're "

"XML sitemaps are useful to the extent that they'll get your site indexed "
